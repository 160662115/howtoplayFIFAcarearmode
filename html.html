<body><font size="10"> i recomend picking a team in the english football system cause the teams are more reconisable and has lots of space for promotion and religation</font></body> 
<body><font size="10"> if your looking to win the prem and the champions leauge than you shoukd pick somthing like liverpool or man city (glory hunter)</font></body) 
<body><font size="10"> But if your looking for a succses story and to reshape a team into greatness you should pick lower in the system. and my recamendations are watford,swansea and notts county.
